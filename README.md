Welcome to the GitHub repository page for **HR Analytics in R: Common HR business tasks done with the power of R** available at [HRAnalaytics.live](https://github.com/Hendrik147/HR_Analytics_in_R_book/). 


## Why such a title for this book?

This is a self-training book to assist you in your journey to HR Analytics. Most importantly it will be your go-to resource when youâ€™re learning, practicing, and implementing stuff in real life. It will leverage the power of open source R language.

## What are the long term objectives of this book?

Demonstrate to an audience of HR professionals the power of open source tools based on common HR business scenarios. Companies should promote in-house open source software much more to build sustainable HR Analytics capabilities, instead of outsourcing tout-court to big HR Analytics global consultancy firms. The R ecosystem is open-source and enterprise-ready professional system, one can rely upon.

## What is the target audience?

Analytically minded HR professionals who have already experience in calculations, visualisations, tables, but who have no previous or only limited knowledge in using open source software tools.
